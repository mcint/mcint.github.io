</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Tools you use every day extend your thinking.  If you build on well-factored
tools, you gain great power.  If you build on convoluted tools, you may one day
find yourself mired in a mess.</p>
<p><code>tmux</code> provides a mostly clear set of interface elements and predictable
interactions.  It's often worth configuring to get the best use of it.</p>
<h2>opinionated .tmux</h2>
<p>https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux (hereafter, dot-tmux) offers an opinionated
setup, so opinionated in fact, that you have to learn it's own Domain-Specific
Language (DSL) to manage its configuration of tmux.  As someone who continually
refines my use of tools, I think this approach is wrong.</p>
<p>Configuration, programming, can be done in a few ways.</p>
<p>Composition or configuration.</p>
<p>tmux offers an expressive configuration format, allowing functions and
transformations</p>
<p>Writing a language over the top of this which allows configuration through new
specially named variables as well as through direct native setting leads to
confusion.  It requires a much deeper understanding of the configuration system
to predict the effect of simple changes.  Without learning a lot more, on par
with some level of rewriting a custom config system, I find myself mired in a
mess.</p>
<p>The new configuration layer runs some of its changes initially, and some of its
changes after reading in the end-user config file.</p>
<p>I was tempted by the promise of easily available, powerful configuration
options. However, opinionated choices and an obscurring, verbose DSL in the
configuation layer make otherwise easy changes unpredictable.</p>
<p>Framework vs library. </p>
<h3>Exploring justifications</h3>
<h4>Composition versus configuration.</h4>
<p>Perhaps I experience that good configuration systems allow expression of a
"composition" of "behaviors" (nouns) of the system.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">behavior</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nv">don</span><span class="err">&#39;t-do behavior-2</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>"Convention over configuration"</li>
<li>"Convention over code"</li>
</ul>
<h4>Framework vs library tmux configuration, raw <code>.tmux.conf</code>, has the flavor</h4>
<p>of a library to me. Many options are directly available.</p>
<p>dot-tmux has the flavor of a framework. It controls how to set most of tmux's
configuration, and clashes with options you can still set directly.</p>
<p>It seems possible to me that a hypothetical lib-conf-tmux could present an
opinionated set of options, that could be called before manually setting your
own overrides to the chosen opinioned defaults.</p>                </article>
