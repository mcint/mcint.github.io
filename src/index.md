## What to expect

This is a home for writing. Something simple, something started, something published.

Writing is a tool for thinking, writing is thinking. Without writing, it's difficult to retrace or recreate thought.


I'd like to write regularly, daily, on whatever comes to mind. From reading, from technical play, from social interaction.

I want to keep a page of [[topics]] under consideration,
in addition to a page, or really tag, about my [[blog methods]].
